7322,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
7323,"@AmericanAir after all, the plane didnÛªt land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs."
7324,@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
7325,@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
7326,@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
7327,"@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?"
7328,@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
7329,@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
7330,"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
7331,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
7332,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
7333,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
7334,@SouthwestAir I will not have my passport in time for my trip. Could I still fly with photo ID? #thingsishouldknow #ifeeldumb
7335,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
7336,@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
7337,"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
7338,@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
7339,@JetBlue Accepting #Apple Pay - Mobile Enterprise http://t.co/Ci5cfrlqBe
7340,@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
7341,@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
7342,@SouthwestAir @AARP #tfw1 Appreciate the tweet back - It was unexpected.
7343,@united what's the status of flight 1008 BogotÌÁ-Houston?
7344,@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
7345,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane _Ù÷¢_Ù÷¥_Ù÷_ #AmericanAirlines"
7346,@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
7347,@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
7348,"@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation."
7349,@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
7350,"@JetBlue hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
7351,"@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!"
7352,@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
7353,"@JetBlue I like Marie Harf go to Iraiq find ISIS and spread good, and offer resume service to ISIS in order to find jobs @marieharf"
7354,@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
7355,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
7356,"@USAirways was on hd for 1hr and 3min at 3:00am since my flgt  from DCA to MSY was Cancelled Flightled, still trying to get out. On hold now 50minssss"
7357,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
7358,"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours"
7359,@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
7360,"@AmericanAir Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA"
7361,@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
7362,@VirginAmerica momma I made it! _Ù÷_Ù÷_Ù÷
7363,@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain

7373,"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail."
7374,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
7375,@SouthwestAir but if my bag makes it with me to Greenville tonight then all is forgiven. #HighHopes
7376,@SouthwestAir Anyone answering phone this morning at 800IFLYSWA? On hold 51 minutes and counting...
7377,"@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule."
7378,"@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase"
7379,@VirginAmerica Can you find us a flt out of LAX that is sooner than midnight on Monday? That would be great customer service _Ù÷Ä
7380,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
7381,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
7382,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
7383,@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
7384,"@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully."
7385,@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
7386,@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR
7387,@AmericanAir thanks
7388,@JetBlue thanks anyways @SouthwestAir has my back! Awesome rate &amp; amazing customer service #nomoreaggravation
7389,@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
7390,@SouthwestAir iPhone App Adds Passbook Support #Airlines #Travel http://t.co/lJzDTHD9Bv
7391,"@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though."
7392,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
7393,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
7394,@SouthwestAir Boooo!!!!!!   Don't be like the other airlines!!  http://t.co/WHAGPknnLF

7401,@JetBlue I thought the same thing after I sent it
7402,@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
7403,"@SouthwestAir are any flights leaving DC today? Flight was Cancelled Flightled, been on hold for over an hour."
7404,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
7405,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
7406,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.

7430,@AmericanAir pathetic service
7431,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
7432,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
7433,@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
7434,@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
7435,"@SouthwestAir thank you, someone finally answered and was able to change my flight that was Cancelled Flighted bc of ice. Thank you for response"

7454,@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.

7565,@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
7566,@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.

7793,@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx
7794,@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
7795,@AmericanAir @Delta @VirginAtlantic I need a vacation from all this ice! http://t.co/45kTsSK18J

7818,@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
7819,@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...

7830,@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
7831,@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
7832,@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
7833,@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
7834,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
7835,"@VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)"
7836,@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
7837,"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?"
7838,"@SouthwestAir Traveling with a 13 year old Thursday. He does not need an ID, correct?"
7839,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head

7843,@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
7844,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
7845,@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail

7854,@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
7855,@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
7856,@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all.
7857,"@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site"

7861,"@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!"
7862,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
7863,"@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself"
7864,"@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait"

7866,@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
7867,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
7868,@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
7869,@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.

7876,"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
7877,@SouthwestAir yes I was everything worked out great
7878,@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
7879,@JetBlue that's what we've been told however how would this work if you're going overseas? Bottom line is passengers feel as if there's (1)
7880,@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
7881,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
7882,@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
7883,@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
7884,@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
7885,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
7886,@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w
7887,"@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed."
7888,@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!!
7889,@SouthwestAir discount for three delays?
7890,Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
7891,@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
7892,@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
7893,@AmericanAir Am I upgraded on my next flight?
7894,@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
7895,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
7896,@VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550?
7897,"@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on."
7898,"@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard ""your bag has not been located."" _Ù÷©"
7899,"@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!"

7901,"@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is ""maybe your bag will come today. We don't know."" Website says ""status unknown""- can you help?"
7902,@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
7903,"@SouthwestAir really this is getting worse as the day goes on. Late Flight leaving then had to be diverted, and now sitting on the tarmac in VA."
7904,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
7905,"@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times."

7907,@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
7908,@SouthwestAir live in Atlanta but cant enroll in your Atlanta companion promotion. Error every time. Can you help? Also sent email. Thanks!
7909,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
7910,@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
7911,@USAirways Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!!
7912,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
7913,@SouthwestAir please do. Hate having to fly a different airline. You're my fav.
7914,@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
7915,@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
7916,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
7917,"@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary"
7918,@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
7919,@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
7920,"@USAirways well, depending on the policy will make the determination as to which airline is selected to travel."
7921,@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
7922,@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
7923,@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it

7934,"@AmericanAir yes yes yes,so glad to be headed home!"

8706,@SouthwestAir  do you know where my plane is coming from?  I'm on SW flight 4464 from RSW to MKE
8707,@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/VD0tLomtwu
8708,"@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!"
8709,@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
8710,"That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t"
8711,@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
8712,@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
8713,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
8714,"@SouthwestAir never mind, I moved my flight to tomorrow. Thanks for the help!"
8715,@SouthwestAir no thanks
8716,@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
8717,@USAirways I have a MAJOR complaint that I want to address w/you about my hand luggage courtesy check-in. What's the best way to do this?
8718,@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
8719,@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
8720,@SouthwestAir thanks to Ella-Mae at LAS counter for going above and beyond to help us get back to ABQ after our flight was Cancelled Flightled!
8721,"@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful"
8722,@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
8723,"@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?"
8724,@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
8725,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
8726,@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
8727,@USAirways 5 hours on the phone waiting for a call back to find my luggage #shameonyou
8728,"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
8729,"@SouthwestAir - I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?"
8730,@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
8731,@SouthwestAir Are we sure flights will not be Cancelled Flighted after 1200 I am trying to make plans in STL
8732,@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
8733,@USAirways No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got.
8734,@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
8735,@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
8736,@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
8737,@USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming
8738,@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
8739,@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
8740,@SouthwestAir why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
8741,@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
8742,@JetBlue Maybe I'll just go to Cleveland instead.
8743,"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
8744,@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.
8745,"@AmericanAir To think that I'm a ""Priority Member""! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately."
8746,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
8747,@united Thank you! Have a nice evening.
8748,@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
8749,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
8750,"@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight"
8751,@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
8752,"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
8753,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
8754,@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
8755,@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
8756,@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
8757,@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
8758,@JetBlue I'll take 3 round trip tickets to the closest warmest place please! #negativedegrees #buffalo #snowwillnevermelt
8759,@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
8760,@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
8761,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you wonÛªt fix it."
8762,@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
8763,"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"
8764,"@SouthwestAir  Tried to DM you, it won't let me as it says you are not following me."
8765,@VirginAmerica Thank you for the follow
8766,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
8767,@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
8768,@JetBlue Just sent it
8769,@SouthwestAir thx - i managed to figure it out by trying diff confirmation #s as i booked. just annoying it's not readily available!
8770,"@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!"
8771,@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
8772,@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
8773,@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
8774,@SouthwestAir New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/iQnVyFPg4P
8775,@SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal.
8776,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
8777,@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
8778,@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
8779,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
8780,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
8781,@SouthwestAir @Matt_e_Boss how long did you have to hold? We waited 35 minutes and gave up
8782,"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure"
8783,@USAirways IÛªd suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
8784,@USAirways @AmericanAir ok the app doesn't seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1
8785,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
8786,@SouthwestAir Thank you. Great tool
8787,@AmericanAir working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)

8790,@united you hung up on me again.
8791,@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
8792,"@VirginAmerica, you're doing a great job adding little luxuries/aesthetics that improve the air travel experience. Thank you. Keep it up!"
8793,"@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
8794,"@SouthwestAir - wow! 100 minutes on hold, so far. Now phone is dying..."
8795,@JetBlue Hello! Can you tell me if you currently fly to Hawaii? Thanks!
8796,"@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still ""Now Boarding""..."

8804,@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
8805,@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
8806,@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
8807,@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
8808,@united please see dm!!
8809,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
8810,@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
8811,@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
8812,@JetBlue I would go anywhere JetBlue goes.
8813,@SouthwestAir got it.  Next time I will know about paying extra to make the A Line.
8814,@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
8815,@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
8816,@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
8817,@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
8818,@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.
8819,"Bruh...real tweet from @JetBlue ""Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dqny4aKTg9"""
8820,@AmericanAir Eventually the call got through. Not sure what changed. Thank you a lot though!
8821,"@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :("
8822,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.

8831,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
8832,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
8833,@AmericanAir my flight out of TYR tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. How long until a rebook?
8834,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
8835,@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
8836,@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
8837,@SouthwestAir - been on hold forever. My first flight was Cancelled Flightled but my 2nd flight is still on time - HELP!
8838,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
8839,@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
8840,@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
8841,@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...

8848,@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
8849,@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?

8907,@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
8908,@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice

8943,"@JetBlue Why doesn't your ""Best Fare Finder"" work?"
8944,@JetBlue is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight.
8945,@VirginAmerica Having an issue finding a missing item on a plane. Can you help me find which airport my plane headed to next?
8946,@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
8947,@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
8948,@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
8949,@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue _Ù÷Ó_Ù÷Ò_Ù÷_
8950,@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
8951,@SouthwestAir what number can we use to all from outside the US? Thx
8952,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
8953,@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
8954,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
8955,"@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles"
8956,"@USAirways to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,
I just used the wrong name"

8959,@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
8960,@USAirways Y'all need to get it together
8961,"@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?"
8962,@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
8963,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
8964,"@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I DO like your airlines, congrats! : )"
8965,@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed

8997,@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
8998,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
8999,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.

9706,@USAirways is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon.
9707,"@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went."
9708,@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
9709,@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you

9764,@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
9765,"@USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr!"

9865,@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
9866,@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
9867,@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!

10100,@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
10101,@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
10102,@SouthwestAir I will be writing in about the service via email. My company also transports well over 100 clients monthly via SW.
10103,@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
10104,@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
10105,@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
10106,@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated
10107,@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
10108,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
10109,@JetBlue Thanks for having us hang out at Tampa Airport forever today!!! It's really been an awesome experience
10110,"@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up."

10114,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
10115,Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
10116,@JetBlue great flight! Great view! :-) http://t.co/Yxn00pnOav
10117,"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"
10118,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
10119,@SouthwestAir There is no way that I am getting back on a plane with your airline. I will be calling to get a refund. As I drive 17 hrs home
10120,@SouthwestAir can take u to Midway-Chicago March 8th-April 6th. Can't make it then? @AmericanAir can get u to @fly2ohare year round. #FlyPBI

10126,@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
10127,@united your customer service is terrible
10128,@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
10129,"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"
10130,@USAirways what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American?
10131,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)Û_tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
10132,@united service staff to is less than friendly!
10133,@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
10134,@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
10135,@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
10136,@united Hi if a premium ec upgrade was paid for &amp; then a mileage BF upgrade done is the prem Eco upgrade fare refunded?
10137,"@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :("
10138,@SouthwestAir Thank You. We'll be in touch! #MoveAboutTheCountry
10139,@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
10140,@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
10141,@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
10142,@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
10143,@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
10144,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
10145,@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
10146,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
10147,@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
10148,"@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
10149,"@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed"
10150,@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
10151,@USAirways what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight?
10152,@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
10153,@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
10154,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
10155,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
10156,@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly _Ù÷´
10157,@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
10158,@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
10159,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
10160,"@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here."
10161,@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations

10169,"@JetBlue Btw, thanks for responding quickly!!"
10170,@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
10171,@USAirways no your not!
10172,@united will I make it with the delay?
10173,@SouthwestAir Making Miracles again! The customer service department gave me by far one of the friendliest phone calls ever. #wheelsup
10174,@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
10175,@JetBlue and @WSJ team up offering in-flight access to journal content http://t.co/PTsbkA4cDJ
10176,"@AmericanAir I have an issue that requires a bit more than a tweet to explain, do yÛªall have an email?"
10177,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
10178,@AmericanAir  that's what I am hoping for
10179,@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
10180,"@JetBlue When chging flight, isit possible to pay the fare difference in dollars when the ticket was bought completely via point redemption?"
10181,@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
10182,@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
10183,"@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer."
10184,@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
10185,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
10186,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
10187,@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
10188,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
10189,"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
10190,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
10191,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
10192,"@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear"
10193,@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
10194,"@SouthwestAir @tbuccheriFRNC3E. It takes 13.5 hours to fly from Chicago to Beijing on United, and 12 to fly from Vegas to Omaha on SW..."
10195,@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
10196,@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
10197,@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
10198,"@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?"
10199,@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
10200,@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
10201,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
10202,"@AmericanAir oh I will, AA on speed dial"
10203,@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outraged_Ù÷Á_Ù÷Á
10204,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
10205,@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
10206,"@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
10207,@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
10208,@VirginAmerica got it squared away. Someone picked up as soon as I tweeted. Should have tweeted sooner. _Ù÷ä
10209,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
10210,@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
10211,@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member
10212,@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
10213,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10214,@SouthwestAir think flight 1945 from BNA to LAX will get off the ground tomorrow??? #please #snowbama

10220,"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"

10223,@JetBlue I flew on a flight about 3 months ago. Me and my girlfriend got away with having sex in a restroom. Is it allowed now?
10224,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
10225,@JetBlue thanks so much. Can't wait to fly with you guys :)
10226,@AmericanAir LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help. Fabulous staff at gate D4 helped-2 young men handled crowd well.

10247,@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.
10248,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"

10277,@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
10278,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there

10772,@JetBlue tell the truth - this is a pic of your social media community managers isn't it? http://t.co/e2AXlqzWvh
10773,@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
10774,"@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable."
10775,@SouthwestAir I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
10776,"@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?"
10777,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
10778,"@JetBlue I would fly to Washington  DC to see the actual Constitution  and the Declaration of Independence, in honor of a US Navy friend."
10779,@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
10780,@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
10781,"@JetBlue Thx for the pointer, but Im good with the big monitor.  Any advice on who I should pick to come our of the Western Conf (NBA)?"
10782,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA

10796,@AmericanAir Please follow me.
10797,@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
10798,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
10799,@united thnx
10800,"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
10801,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
10802,@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
10803,@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!

10805,"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
10806,"@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours..."

10808,@JetBlue you guys need live chat.
10809,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
10810,"@USAirways Yes, I get that. IÛªm asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback IÛªve given you?"
10811,"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
10812,@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral

10997,@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV

11002,@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
11003,@SouthwestAir Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast.
11004,@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
11005,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!

11007,"@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will turn 2 during the trip do I have to buy a return ticket for my child?"
11008,@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited

11017,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
11018,"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
11019,@SouthwestAir Hi I just got a message that part of my flights is Cancelled Flightled. I can't rebook online and nobody answers my phone call. Help me
11020,@SouthwestAir I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours.

11023,@united I am impressed with your super-fast reply to @CGJase

11025,@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
11026,@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
11027,@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
11028,@JetBlue your blue helped bring out the color of my eyes. And I promise I didn't eat all the free snacks.

11030,@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.

11037,"@JetBlue thanks so much for help Us, u r amazing!"
11038,@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
11039,@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
11040,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
11041,@united thank you!
11042,@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.

11064,"@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!"
11065,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"

11069,@SouthwestAir booked the 8th.... Save me an emergency exit... Gotta stretch out
11070,@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
11071,@JetBlue no. Did not catch his name. I am sure Jason will know.
11072,@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
11073,@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
11074,@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.

11076,@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
11077,@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
11078,@SouthwestAir This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons

11080,"@USAirways tough night, two 90 minute calls, on hold, delayed here in Phoenix for two days because of one aircraft not ready? Not acceptable"
11081,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
11082,@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
11083,@USAirways 23 min on hold... Drove 2.5 hours to get my delayed bag. I just want to pick it up at SJU.

11088,@united They held the plane! Made it!!
11089,"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."

11093,@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
11094,@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol _Ù÷Ä
11095,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
11096,@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
11097,@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then

11102,@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
11103,@VirginAmerica cutest salt and pepper shaker ever. Just when I think you guys can't get any better you just do! http://t.co/vC6Keulg2J
11104,@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
11105,"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."
11106,@USAirways we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't.
11107,@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
11108,"@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah, GA"
11109,"@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should"

11120,@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
11121,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother

11449,"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
11450,"@SouthwestAir Been on hold over 90 minutes. You can fly, but not answer the phone?"
11451,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.

I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?"
11555,@USAirways @AmericanAir. delay and mechanical issues on both my weekend flights. Ridiculous. Will tweet as long as we are delayed
11556,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.

11573,"@JetBlue we're home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon?"
11574,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability

11627,@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?

11643,@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?
11644,"@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!"
11645,@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
11646,@JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
11647,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
11648,@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
11649,@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.

11665,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
11666,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC."

11673,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
11674,"@SouthwestAir thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though."
11675,@SouthwestAir i hope i can be apart of the team with this job opening!
11676,@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
11677,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
11678,"@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!"
11679,@SouthwestAir once again on Glassdoor's Best Places To Work snagging # 15 overall #notsurprising #LUVthem
11680,@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
11681,@JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights.
11682,@USAirways your agent did not say
11683,@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
11684,@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
11685,@AmericanAir Thank you.
11686,@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
11687,@JetBlue 266 at LGB in Sunny So Cal http://t.co/V015PK7DSi

11689,@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
11690,Why we can't have nice things. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/HP9RPPCvHx
11691,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
11692,"@JetBlue we have just landed, thank you anyway. Btw, flight staff on flight 654 were wonderful despite their full day and heavy load."
11693,@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
11694,@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
11695,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
11696,"@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel"
11697,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
11698,"@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/tZZJhuIbCH #CheapFlights #FareCompare"
11699,@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
11700,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
11701,@JetBlue You definitely will!
11702,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
11703,@USAirways HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet
11704,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
11705,@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
11706,@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flights arrivals &amp; departures in Nashville as of 5pm. That and more weather headlines @ 4pm #LiveOnFOX17 #FebruaryFreezeFox17
11707,@SouthwestAir I've DM'd you. Thanks!
11708,@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!

11710,"@SouthwestAir, thanks for being so good to us #military folk. It's cold in #StLouis but I sure enjoyed my flight. http://t.co/RcdH183Q1J"

11714,@AmericanAir no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!! #sna2ord #1644
11715,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
11716,@USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways
11717,@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
11718,@SouthwestAir okay just signed up!
11719,"@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX"
11720,@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?
11721,"@united 
I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years.
You've still got me hooked.
(for now!)
Peace."
11722,"@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united _ÙÔ"

11725,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.

11730,@JetBlue thank you :-)
11731,@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
11732,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane_Ù÷Á
11733,"@SouthwestAir Is the 1,750 bonus at 1800Flowers still on or did it expire 2/14/15?"

12048,@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
12049,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
12050,@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
12051,@JetBlue Phew!! Did it!! (Pant. Wheeze) http://t.co/ZPZ78POeON
12052,Happy #TT to my friends @AmericanAir . Hope the weather isn't causing you too many headaches.

12077,@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
12078,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
12079,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.

12269,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
12270,@SouthwestAir you're going to compensate us for the two plane changes in Atlanta right?

12290,@JetBlue hi friend! Question for you when you have a moment.
12291,"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
12292,@USAirways next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air
12293,@USAirways Thanks for the information!
12294,"@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable."
12295,@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
12296,@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx

12354,@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
12355,"@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?"
12356,"@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight...."
12357,@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
12358,"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
12359,@JetBlue - I look forward to getting this resolved. I will be in touch.
12360,@SouthwestAir Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston.
12361,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really donÛªt need this much trouble.
12362,@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
12363,@united why do you hate your passengers?
12364,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
12365,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
12366,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
12367,@USAirways  to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is
12368,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
12369,@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
12370,"@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning."
12371,@USAirways how do you have only 1 flight into lexington this afternoon with the #1 @KentuckyMBB playing a big game tonight?  #DoBetter
12372,@USAirways just now but no general announcement
12373,"@JetBlue Ok great thanks! I had a great flight, FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in."
12374,"@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?"
12375,@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
12376,@AmericanAir could you guys follow me so I can dm yall please
12377,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
12378,@SouthwestAir tried online and told I must call b/c of modifications to my reservation. Been on hold for almost 2 hours.
12379,@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
12380,"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
12381,@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
12382,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
12383,"@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?"
12384,"@AmericanAir Joanna is wonderful, new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! Thank You!"
12385,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
12386,@SouthwestAir My DM won't go through but it is 261633561838. Please let me know if you need anything else.
12387,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
12388,"@SouthwestAir my trip is a month away...why do you consider it ""around the corner""? Is that a setting I can change?"
12389,@USAirways care to elaborate on why CHA to DCA is Cancelled Flightled this evening?
12390,@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
12391,"@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep ""if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow."" 1/2"
12392,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
12393,@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
12394,@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
12395,@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
12396,@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
12397,@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
12398,@united thnx!
12399,@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
12400,@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
12401,@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay
12402,"@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay."
12403,@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
12404,@united how about starting without the robotic response?
12405,@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!
12406,@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&amp;B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
12407,@JetBlue Using JetBlue miles?
12408,@USAirways is really good at deferring responsibility.
12409,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
12410,@SouthwestAir Thank you ^AH. Still wish someone picked up the phone - 3hrs- dead phone. Taking your tweet as a refund confirmation.
12411,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
12412,@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
12413,@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
12414,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
12415,"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm."
12416,@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
12417,@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
12418,@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
12419,"@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone

12422,@JetBlue why won't the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin?
12423,@united I filled out the form but I havenÛªt received any sort of email confirmation that itÛªs been received. Is that normal?
12424,@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
12425,@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
12426,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."

12433,@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
12434,"@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"
12435,@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless

12886,@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.

12924,"@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time."
12925,@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
12926,@united Followback so I can DM plz
12927,@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
12928,@united thanks for more timely updates.
12929,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
12930,@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
12931,@united your seats are god awful.

12974,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
12975,@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?

13474,@USAirways do you know what flight the pilots for 1581 are coming in on? Thanks.

13722,@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???

13742,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.

14172,@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!

14176,"@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury."

14178,@USAirways how long is that flight? http://t.co/bCwckWtnlE
14179,@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
14180,"@AmericanAir called last night, after 10hrs got call back, can I get a one day pass to admirals club? I'm going to be spending 7hrs in DFW"
14181,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
14182,@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
14183,"@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
14184,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
14185,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
14186,"@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air..."
14187,@SouthwestAir been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives?
14188,@AmericanAir Thank you
14189,@AmericanAir thank you
14190,"@SouthwestAir worst customer service, Terrible attitudes. I don't care how big a storm.  Your employees need an attitude adjustment"
14191,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
14192,@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
14193,@united its available online I just can't figure out how to do it to guarantee same flight
14194,"ÛÏ@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/pa7dCjXlzLÛ

C'mon fam_Ù÷__Ù÷_ just. No. Ok?"
14195,@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
14196,@SouthwestAir I lost my luggage. My birthday wish is to find my luggage.
14197,"@SouthwestAir I have a flight to Vegas coming up soon, but havenÛªt received any drink tickets Late Flightly. Can you help me out?"
14198,"@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks."
14199,"@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
14200,@SouthwestAir finally through thx
14201,"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
14202,@AmericanAir do you still use DC9's?
14203,@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
14204,@USAirways I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain
14205,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
14206,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
14207,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
14208,@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
14209,@VirginAmerica LAX to EWR - Middle seat on a red eye. Such a noob maneuver. #sendambien #andchexmix
14210,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
14211,@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated
14212,@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
14213,@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
14214,@SouthwestAir That would be brighter than all the stars combined on the red carpet tonight!
14215,"@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX."
14216,@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
14217,@AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can't tell me where it is. I've lost $1000 of stuff :( #AmericanAirlines #unamericanairlines
14218,@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
14219,@AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ

14223,@SouthwestAir not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18.
14224,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
14225,@JetBlue That's pretty nice. Are flight credits automatically given after the flight? I also wish there were a lounge I could sleep in.
14226,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
14227,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
14228,@united thank you for the help!!
14229,@JetBlue *cough* #awkward!
14230,@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
14231,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
14232,@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
14233,@SouthwestAir tv stream means I get to spend my flight watching 1999 and 2011 Women's World Cup Finals. #throwback #bestflightever
14234,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
14235,@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
14236,@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
14237,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
14238,@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
14239,@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
14240,@VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin
14241,"@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones"
14242,".@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it."
14243,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
14244,@USAirways really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher.
14245,Alright... Someone has to stop this! RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lchVJoliDg

14251,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
14252,"@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight."
14253,@JetBlue @ProfessorpaUL15 Always happy to help!
14254,@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
14255,"@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!"
14256,@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Of7PFvQpOY
14257,@USAirways IÛªll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
14258,"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
14259,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
14260,@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
14261,"@USAirways @ALfamilyoffour maybe if there was anyone answering the phone they would. ""Please call back Late Flightr"".For 18 hours? Not good enough"
14262,@united please reroute Oregon Women's Tennis to Santa Barbara. There's supposedly another connection from LA.
14263,@JetBlue I'm flying your airline just out of #LGA _Ù÷á
14264,@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta
14265,@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
14266,@USAirways Ill never fly you again due to the emotional &amp; financial stress you have caused me because of one of your staff members errors.
14267,@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
14268,@SouthwestAir I need to reschedule a flight and I've been on hold for almost an hour. This is ridiculous. Is there a best number to call?
14269,@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
14270,@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
14271,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
14272,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
14273,"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come"

14278,@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
14279,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
14280,@southwestair @cspkcats let us know if we can help
14281,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
14282,@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
14283,@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
14284,@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
14285,@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
14286,.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
14287,@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
14288,@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated
14289,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
14290,@JetBlue mission accomplished: gave @paulgordonbrown  a hug http://t.co/LT1pYKfvRq
14291,"@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option."
14292,@JetBlue works with Google #chrome but not Internet Explorer.
14293,@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
14294,@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
14295,"@USAirways your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude!"

14355,@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
14356,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
14357,@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
14358,@AmericanAir thank you!

14436,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful

14601,@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?
14602,@united what do you have in mind?
14603,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
14604,@united no my concerns were not addressed
14605,@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
14606,@SouthwestAir companion pass please!
14607,@JetBlue tried again. Lovely customer service. Thank you!
14608,@SouthwestAir  getting the run around today with customer service &amp; disconnected customer relations # given twice. Help!!!
14609,@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
14610,"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk"" {sees line ~45 people deep}"
14611,@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
14612,@united I have.
14613,@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
14614,@VirginAmerica Will flights be leaving Dallas for LA on February 24th?
14615,@SouthwestAir On hold waiting to make special accommodations for my mom who is traveling 1 hour and 24 minutes on hold.  Unacceptable!
14616,"@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?"
14617,@JetBlue Thanks. Which day of the week is the direct?  The flights I saw went thru JFK   ÷Ûü
14618,@AmericanAir Joanne from your San Diego staff was phenomenal! Give that girl a raise. She handled our #flightnightmare better than anyone.
14619,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
14620,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
14621,"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"
14622,@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
14623,@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
14624,"@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS"
14625,"@united thats weak. See ya _ÙÔÜ
Hey @VirginAmerica !!"
14626,@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
14627,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
14628,@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
14629,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
14630,@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
14631,@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
14632,"@AmericanAir You don't have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That's why we're done here."
14633,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
14634,@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
14635,"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
14636,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
14637,"@JetBlue Traveling with two kids tomorrow (ages 7 and 4) domestic, do they need birth certificates to check in at airport?"
14638,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
14639,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
14640,@USAirways really!??
14641,@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
